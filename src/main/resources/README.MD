SIMPLE_WEB_SERVER

Provides a simple webserver that avoids the use of HTTP processing libraries.  Provides support for two GET requests and one POST request.  One GET request returns the contents of a file directory.  The other GET request returns a .png file from that directory.  The POST request supports uploading a file and saving it in that directory.  The server is designed to be used from the CLI.
